    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Ratatouille is a summer vegetable stew that originated as a French Provencal dish from Nice. Think of the vegetables that grow well in your yard, ready to be picked together in late summer and early fall — that’s ratatouille. It's a stew of zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and eggplant, with herbs and spices and some onions and garlic usually thrown in for good measure. The coast of Provence is on the Mediterranean Sea and has a climate similar to California’s, which means the growing season for the vegetables in ratatouille are available for many months. You wouldn’t have it at dinner for New Year’s Eve, but you might have it in late October through mid-November.
